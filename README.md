# CyberSecurity_Incident_Analysis_dashboard(Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel, Python, and Power BI)

## Project Objective
To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes cybersecurity incidents across countries and industries, identifying attack types, financial losses, affected users, and defense mechanisms. The goal was to uncover actionable insights to enhance threat response strategies and improve incident resolution efficiency.

##Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/VishalMakwana1833/CyberSecurity_Incident_Analysis_dashboard/blob/main/Cybersecurity_data.csv">CyberSecurity Data</a>

##Questions KPIs
- Total Financial Loss
- Total Affected Users
- Average Incident Resolution Time (in Hours)
- Most Common Attack Type
- Most Common Defense Mechanism
- Year with Highest Financial Loss
- Dashboard Interaction<a href="https://github.com/VishalMakwana1833/CyberSecurity_Incident_Analysis_dashboard/blob/main/CyberSecurity_dashboard.jpg">View Dashboard</a>

##Process
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset using Python (Pandas) handled missing values, standardized column names, converted data types, and removed duplicates.
- Imported cleaned data into Power BI, created a data model, and built DAX measures for key performance indicators like Total Financial Loss and Most Common Attack Type.
- Designed a dynamic dashboard using cards, bar charts, treemaps, and slicers to visualize attack trends, sources, impacted industries, and resolution timelines.

##Project Insights
- Phishing and Malware were the most common attack types, contributing to over 60% of recorded cybersecurity incidents.
- Cloud-based and internal network sources were identified as the top origins of attacks, indicating increased risk in remote infrastructure.
- Countries like the USA, India, and UK reported the most incidents, often tied to higher digital exposure and targeted infrastructure.
- The average incident resolution time exceeded 36 hours, revealing potential gaps in real-time response mechanisms.

##Conclusion
The Cybersecurity Incident Analysis Dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of global cyber threats, revealing critical patterns in attack types, sources, and their impacts. Through data-driven insights, the project highlighted the increasing frequency of cyber attacks, with phishing and malware as the most common methods and the finance sector facing the highest financial losses.
